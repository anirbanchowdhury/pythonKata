    "## Agenda\n",
    "- Basic concepts on programming language and Python\n",
    "- Familiarise with Jupyter notebook\n",
    "- Turtle programming\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also proceed at your own (faster) pace if you like and proceed to day 2 material. If you have any questions on more advanced sections, please wait till we catchup to the respective section. :)\n",

    "## Pre-requisite\n",
    "Follow AnacondaSetup.docx to setup Anaconda prior to this session.\n",

    "## Basic Concepts\n",
    "### Computer Programs\n",
    "- a set of instructions that tells a computer what to do or how to perform a task\n",
    "- e.g. Outlook - the set of instructions might be: Open that email.\n",
    "- It's like a TODO list, if you can understand a TODO list, you can understand a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programming\n",
    "Programming is the art and science of creating computer programs by typing out the list of instructions that we want the computer to execute in order to accomplish our objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programming Language\n",
    "Just like any other human language, a programming language has alphabet, symbols and rules/grammar. Instead of communicating to a human being, we will use it to communicate with the compute to execute what we want and how we want it. An example of a programming language is **Python**, which we will use in this workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Translators - Compilers and Interpreters\n",
    "Computers only understand binary (0 and 1), but we will write in English-like language. A translator sits in between and translates our English-like language (Python) into computer lingo. For the case of Python, it's called an **interpreter**.\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, enough theory - let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Drawing with Turtle\n",
    "Click on the grey box below, you should see a cursor blink.\n",
    "Press `Ctrl+Enter` and see what happens."

    "### Importing a module\n",
    "First, we **imported** the `turtle` library. **Turtle** is a **library** that features something like a drawing board, which lets you command a turtle to draw all over it. Libraries are code written by people that we can `import` and use, instead of writing all of it ourselves!"

    "The above commands draw a single long ellipsis. Now we want to keep repeating the action. One can write the same command over and over again many atimes. Luckily programming languages has something called `loops` which repeats the same commands as many times as we want. Which is why used `while(True)`. As the word suggests, those actions will be executed forever. To break out of the loop, we use a conditional. These will be covered more in part 3.\n",
