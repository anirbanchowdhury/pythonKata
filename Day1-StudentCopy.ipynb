    "\n",
    "Computer programs or software is a set of instructions that tells a computer what to do or how to perform a task. Eg. of a software program is Outlook and the set of instructions might be open that email. Another example is Excel or Word etc. \n",

    "### Programming\n",
    "Programming is the art and science of creating computer programs by typing out the list of instructions that we want the computer to execute in order to accomplish our objective. This might appear challenging at first, but you will find that it becomes easier with practice. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programming Language\n",
    "Just like any other human language, a programming language has alphabet, symbols and rules/grammar. Instead of communicating to a human being, we will use it to communicate with the computer to execute what we want and how we want it. An eg. of a programming language is Python which we will use in this workshop. \n",
